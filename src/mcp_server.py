    """Search indexed documents for relevant text fragments using semantic similarity.

    Use this tool whenever the user asks a question that might be answered by the
    indexed document collection (e.g. "What does X say about Y?", "Summarize the
    chapter on Z", "Find information about X in the documents"). Always prefer
    this over guessing or fabricating content.

    Args:
        question: A detailed natural-language query. More specific queries yield
            better results. Example: "What are the safety protocols for chemical
            storage?" rather than just "safety".
        document: Optional document/collection name to restrict search. Use
            list_documents_tool() first to discover exact names. If omitted, searches
            all indexed documents.
        rerank: Whether to apply cross-encoder re-ranking for higher precision.
            If None, uses the default from config. Enable for complex queries
            where precision matters more than speed.
        top_k: Maximum number of results to return. If None, uses the config
            default (8). Increase for broad queries that may span multiple
            sections.

    Returns: Formatted text fragments with source references (document, chapter, page).
        Each fragment includes enough context to answer the query. If nothing
        relevant is found, returns "No relevant fragments found."

    Args:

        document: Optional document/collection name to restrict search. Use
